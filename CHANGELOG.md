#### Changed
- Because of the new *context-menu*:

  - the *edit* action has been moved to the *context-menu*.
  - the *delete* action has been moved to the *context-menu*.
  - the *enabled* option (from the *Editor Page*) has been moved to the *context-menu*.
- It's now possible to choose which rules to *export* (in the options page). 
- Reworked the injection process. Now it should be more stable and secure.
