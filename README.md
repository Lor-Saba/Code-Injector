# Code-Injector
A [WebExtensions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions) based addon which let the user inject code into the websites

> This is an add-on which requires a minimum of knowledge of web programming to be able to properly use it.

## Purpose

There are several sites with invasive popups / login screens, a messy layout or some missing capabilities.  
I was usually getting around these boring stuff by opening the browser console to edit the DOM style and structure but it was starting to get tiring doing it everytime, so why not making an extension which do it by itself in background?

## Quick start

Get started creating a new *[Rule](https://github.com/Lor-Saba/Code-Injector#rules)*.  
[<img src="readme-resources/screenshots/1.png" height="100">](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lor-Saba/Code-Injector/master/readme-resources/screenshots/1.png)
[<img src="readme-resources/screenshots/2.png" height="100">](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lor-Saba/Code-Injector/master/readme-resources/screenshots/2.png)

Complete the *Rule* by entering the [*URL Pattern* and *Contents*](https://github.com/Lor-Saba/Code-Injector#editor-view),  
then save and reload the page (or navigate to the matching address) to apply your script.

--------------

## Main view (Rules list)
<img src="readme-resources/screenshots/view_ruleslist.png">

The *Main view* is the initial and main page of the addon where you can create and manage your code injections with a list of *Rules*.

#### Rules

A *Rule* may contain **JavaScript**, **CSS**, **HTML** and **Files** and will be splitted and injected with the following order:  

 1. Files (from top to bottom) 
 2. CSS
 3. HTML
 4. JavaScript

>**Note:**  
>Each rule will inherit the previous injected code. 

#### Rules structure
<img src="readme-resources/screenshots/rule_structure.png">

The *Rule*'s element bar can be subdivided into 3 sections:  *Pattern*, *Insight* and *Actions*.

- **Pattern:**  
  The Rule's *Pattern*, as defined [here](https://github.com/Lor-Saba/Code-Injector#url-pattern) in the *Editor section*, specifies in what pages the rule should be applied.    
  It will be highlighted in blue if it matches with the address of the current page. (it's dotted if injected in iframes)   
  If the rule is disabled the *Patern* is highlighted in red with a line over the text.  
  Also, the whole area is draggable allowing to move the *Rule* and change the injection order.

- **Insight:**  
  Shows a minimal description of the Rule whether contains or not a language using 4 coloured dots.  
  (from left to right: *JavaScript*, *CSS*, *HTML* and *Files*)

- **Actions:** 
  - **Edit**  
    Open the Rule in the *Editor view*.  

  - **Inject**  
    Manually inject the Rule into the current tab.  

  - **Move Top**  
    Move the rule as first of the list.  

  - **Move Bottom**  
    Move the rule as last of the list.   

  - **Enabled**  
    define if the current Rule can be injected. 

  - **Delete**   
    Delete the Rule. (must be clicked twice) 




## Editor view
<img src="readme-resources/screenshots/view_editor.png">

The *Editor view* is where can be defined a [*Rule*](https://github.com/Lor-Saba/Code-Injector#rules) codes and properties. 

#### URL pattern

The URL pattern specifies in what pages the rule should be applied.  

When a page is opened, the pattern will be matched against the full address of the new page, if the pattern corresponds with that address then the code contained in the rule will be injected into the page.  

The URL pattern follows the ECMAScript (a.k.a. JavaScript) regular expressions syntax, see [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions) for more detailed information.  

The add-on helps you on checking whether the pattern is correct by highlighting it in blue if it matches with the address of the current page and highlight it in red if it is invalid.  

In depth example in case of *google* as url pattern:  
*<small style="color: #555">(this example is just for knowledge purposes)</small>*  

```javascript
    // the URL pattern "google" is passed as argument 
    // by the "URL Pattern" to the RegExp constructor.
    new RegExp("google");

    // resulting in..
    /google/

    // assuming "https://www.google.com" as page address:
    /google/.test("https://www.google.com");

    // if TRUE the rule will be queued for injection

```  

> **Note:**  
> Because the URL pattern text box is meant to contain only a regular expression, the forward slashes / used as delimiters in the JavaScript language are not needed.  
*You should therefore write `hello world` instead of `/hello world/`*.

#### Editors

The main section of the *Editor view*.  

From left to right you can access the *JavaScript*, *CSS*, *HTML* editors and the *Files* manager by clicking on the tabs.  

>**Note:**  
>If an editor contains just comments the code wont be injected. 



#### Files

In the *Files* tab you can manage the injection of __local*__ or __remote__ files.  

While typing the file path, an icon should appear on the right side of the input area indicating whether the file is remote or local and it's type (js/css/html) in blue.  
If the file extension is not recognized as one of the 3 types mentioned above then the icon will show a red "X" on the edge and the file will be skipped from injection.  

>**Note:**  
>The file type can forced by clicking on the icon and selecting the supposed language from the dropdown menu.

>**Note: (Firefox 57+ on Windows)**  
>While playing around a bit with the injection of local files (using firefox on windows) I noticed that there's something which is blocking the add-on from reading files in some folders. 
>(maybe some kind of user read access control introduced in the newer versions of firefox? 57+ ). 
>For example, it is possible to read without problems from the root folder ( C:\ ) but not from the Desktop or Documents. 
>Checking the folders permissions (right click > properties > Security) there is "Everyone" listed in "Users & groups" section where it's possible to read the file.  
>I'm not sure if this is the main reason for that behavior, further investigations are required.  

>**IMPORTANT:**  
>The injection of *local* files is experimental and could stop working anytime with browser's updates.

#### On page load:

If `TRUE`, the rule will be injected on page load, else it will be injected on navigation.  
Check the [Injection flow](https://github.com/Lor-Saba/Code-Injector#injection-flow) for more details.

#### Top frame only:

`TRUE` by default, if set to `FALSE` the rule will be injected to the iframes too.



## Options view
<img src="readme-resources/screenshots/view_options.png">

#### Saved rules

A simple section wich shows the number of total registered rules and a button to remove them all.

> **Note:**  
> The *Clean* button must be clicked twice to confirm the action.

#### Size

Define the size of the popup window. (in px)

#### Import / Export

**Export:**  
- Press on the *export button* to show the "export modal".  
- In the "export modal" will be listed all your *Rules*.  
- Select which rules you'd like to export and click on the *export button*.  
(At least 1 rule has to be selected to enable the *export button*)  
The selected *Rules* will be downloaded as a json file.  
  
**Import:**  
- Press on the *import button* to show the "import modal".   
- You can chose from 3 types of import method:  
  1) *Local JSON File*  
    Navigate into your system and select a file containing a valid *JSON* of *Rules*.  
  2) *Remote JSON File*   
    give a remote file URL containing a valid *JSON* of *Rules*.  
    Example: `https://www.mydomain.com/path/to/ruleslist.json`
  2) *GitHub repository*  
    Import a rule from a GitHub repository address.  
    Example: [`https://github.com/Lor-Saba/Code-Injector-GitHub-Rule`](https://github.com/Lor-Saba/Code-Injector-GitHub-Rule)  
- Click on the *import button* to confirm.

> **Note:**
  A message should appear to tell whether the operation is successful or not. 

#### Show counter

If `true`, a badge with the number of currently injected rules will be visible over the icon.  





## Injection flow

A *Rule* by default is set up to be injected on page load *(after the document and all its resources have finished loading)* but can be changed to be injected when the navigation is committed *(the DOM is recived and still loading)* by deselecting the property "[On page load](https://github.com/Lor-Saba/Code-Injector#on-page-load)" in the *Editor view*.

The rules whose *URL Pattern* match with the page address will be selected and queued for injection. (from top to bottom, grouped by type)

## What's next 

I would like to make it more and more easy to use so that even who's new to programming can use this add-on with ease.
